# Operating-Systems-Project
A flight ticket booking system based on client - server communication

This project focuses on the complete management of a flight reservation/booking system. Customers can make reservations/modifications/cancellations online through the main server. The server is able to handle many customers simultaneously at any time.

Customers are assumed to be the clients in the system, and they can make a booking by contacting the server.

This project involves working with threads, synchronization, and message passing in a client-server environment.
